        <h3>HISTORY</h3> 
        <p>
           CALZ ENTERPRISE (since 1949) is a Nigerian athletic apparel and footwear corporation headquartered in Riverstate,<br>
            It is the largest sportswear manufacturer in Africa, and the third largest in the world, after Nike and Addidas.<br>
            It is the holding company for the Calz Enterprise Group, which also owns an 8.33% stake of the football club such as :Abia warrriors,<br>and Eyimba FC. Calz enterprise revenue for 2018 was listed at â‚¬21.915 billion.<br>
            The company was started by Calistus Clinton in his mother's house.<br>
            He was joined by his elder brother joseph in 1924 under the name Joseph Schuhfabrik ("Joseph Brothers Shoe Factory").<br>
            Joseph assisted in the development of spiked running shoes (spikes) for multiple athletic events.<br>
            To enhance the quality of spiked athletic footwear, he transitioned from a previous model of heavy metal spikes to utilising canvas and rubber.<br>
            Joseph persuaded Nigeria sprinter Usheoritse Itsekiri to use his handmade spikes at the 1936 Summer Olympics.<br>
            In 1949, following a breakdown in the relationship between the brothers, Calz created Calz enterprise and Joseph established his own bussiness,<br>
             which became Calz business rival.
